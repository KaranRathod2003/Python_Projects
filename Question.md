To create the quiz game in Python:

Start with a score of 0.
For the first question, only add points if correct; no deduction for wrong answers.
From the second question onward, deduct 1 point for each wrong answer.
If the score drops below zero, end the game and display the final score.
The quiz consists of 10 questions; if all are answered correctly, display "Game Won."
If any score between 0 and 10 is maintained after 10 questions, display the final score.
